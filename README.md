The motivation for this project wsa to create a sort of backend for a social media application where users can share their thoughts, react to their friends thoughts, and create a freind list. The code doesnt solve any inherently problem other than making a more strewamlined backend of ra supposed social media site. In this project we learned more about NoSQL databases, like MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM. Express was also used and explored more deeply than before.

## Installation
To install this web application, you first have to install all of the web application's dependancies through npm. You can do this by ``npm i`` in the terminal in the root directory of the repository.
## Usage
To use this software you first have to start the server by either useing Nodemon or simply Node by inputting into the terminal: ``nodemon server.js`` or ``node server.js`` This starts the server and syncs the Mongoose models to the MongoDB database. You casn then use Insomnia to stest the routes for users and thoughts. Remember, the application doesn't come pre-loaded with users and thoughts so you will have to create some before you can use the Get routes with any effectiveness.
